### Description
This module modifies how the encumbrance bar in the actor sheet is displayed to distinguish the different levels of encumbrance when using the variant rules in **PHB pg. 175**. It does not currently support the Powerful Build feature, as doing so would require extending the base Actor5eSheet class.
