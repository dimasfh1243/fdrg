### Description
TLDR: Create token automated token patrols
Using this mod, you will be able to set up "Patrol Routes" which tokens will move to based on a timing of your choice. This can give certain scenes a more life like appearance! Make your markets full of life and give your castles that patrolling retinue they've always needed!
