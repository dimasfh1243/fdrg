### Description
This module turns the d20 icon near the chat prompt into a clickable link that opens up a new dice calculator dialog. The dice calculator includes buttons for dice, numbers, attributes for the selected token, and simple math. In addition, it includes support for inline dice rolls, such as `[[2d6 + @abil.str.mod]]` in chat. [Screenshot of the calculator can be found here.](https://i.imgur.com/53XmxEN.png)
