### Description
This module contains a set of features that improve the Quality of Life of the DMs and Players.

The current features are :

- **Advanced Macros**: Use async script macros, handlebars templating, recursive macro calls and call macros with arguments or directly from chat.
- **Split Journal :** Select the split option from the context menu on a journal entry to split it into multiple entries.
- **Tokens :** As GM, you can enable/disable token vision for yourself. You can also drop an actor folder into a scene to deploy multiple tokens at once.
- **Combat :** Double click the initiative value in the combat tracker to quickly modify it.
- **Playlists : **Adds a 'Now Playing' section, and auto-hides sound controls until hovered. Helps in fine tuning of low level volumes.
