### Description
This module came about after looking at walls generated in DunGen and a discussion with Atropos about how to reduce the number or walls by merging neighbouring walls. For hand drawn maps there is only a small decrease but for DunGen and maps imported from Roll20 modules there can be 30% reduction in the number of walls. The results are not too far from hand crafted wall layouts.

Backup your world before trying as it will change the walls in your world permanently. See the Readme.md for how to use.
