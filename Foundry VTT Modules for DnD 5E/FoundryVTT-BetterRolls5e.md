### Description
This module modifies certain sheet functions on Foundry VTT Character sheets for D&D 5th Edition. Currently, it adds compound rolls (for attack rolls and damage rolls combined), as well as "dual rolls" for all attacks, ability checks, and saving throws, rolling 2 d20s side-by-side in a single chat message. Additionally, it allows for "extra damage" rolls and configurable quick rolls for each item that can show desired details & rolls of an item on the sheet whenever it's clicked. On top of all this are a few options to customize layout and enable/disable certain features of the module.
It currently supports the DnD5e Character and NPC sheets, Better NPC Sheet 5e, and Sky5e sheets, though adding support for other sheets is simple.
