### Description
This module provides a variant layout of the Core 5e Character Sheet in Foundry as well as providing some upgrades to various sections of the sheet.

* Enables rolling ability checks and saving throws directly instead of clicking through a popup
  * Best combined with Red Reign's BetterRoll5e module: https://github.com/RedReign/FoundryVTT-BetterRolls5e
* Adds the ability to click Known Languages under Traits to send the list to the chat window
* Adds Tool, Armor, and Weapon proficiencies beneath Skills
* Saves the scrollbar position when adding/deleting items from your inventory, features, or spellbook
