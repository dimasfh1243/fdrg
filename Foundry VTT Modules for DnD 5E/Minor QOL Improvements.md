### Description
Adds item deletion confirmation, accelerated dice rolls with attack and damage in one click and item info hiding. All features can be enabled/disabled from the in-game module settings. If enabling/disabling speed-item-rolls you should reload the browser window.

To install paste the manifest link into the foundry "add a module" or download the zip and unzip in your module directory.

Many thanks to @Red Rein @Hooking for allowing me to pillage their code.
