* The same works for **importing all spells** from any D&D Beyond spell page, empowering your NPCs in unimaginable ways
* You can **import your D&D Beyond characters**, or better: Let your player's import their characters to have an great representation of their character right within Foundry.
* Additionally, you can **roll monster checks, saves, spells and attacks** straight from the D&D Beyond monster's page without you opening NPC sheets within Foundry
