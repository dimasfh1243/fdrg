### Description
Do you find yourself forgetting to roll on the critical hit table? The critical fumble table? Do you find yourself forgetting to roll that pesky loot table after each monster dies?

Then you're like me and this mod is what you need! Critical-fumble will automatically roll on the critical hit tables in the event of a critical hit! Each hit rolls a special table depending on the type of damage.

Additionally, every time a targeted monster is felled by your players, the CR table is rolled! To further your convience, the coins dropped can be automatically distributed to your players. This option can be ignored though!
