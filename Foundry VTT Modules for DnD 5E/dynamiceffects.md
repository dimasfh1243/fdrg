Dynamic effects is a replacement for dynamic items. It has been completely rewritten see New Features for changes

* Dynamic effects lets you apply item based effects to your character or targeted tokens, adding/decreasing attack/damage bonuses, increasing/decreasing maximum hit points, changing alignment, in fact almost any field on the character sheet can be adjusted by dynamiceffects.
* The module is not dnd5e dependent, although there is additional support for dnd5e.
* All of the changes exist in game only, the saved version of the actor remains unchanged, with the excpetion that active effect modifiers are stored in a flag so they can be reapplied when the game reloads.
* Effects are created/edited from the item sheet which has an additional tab, Effects.
* An effect is just an actor field specifier (i.e. Attributes HP Max) a mode +/= (add value or set value) and a value. A value can be any valid value for the field with some additional options.
