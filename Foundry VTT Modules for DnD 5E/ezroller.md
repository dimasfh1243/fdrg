### Description
Causes item cards to open in a window rather than in chat.  This allows you to open the item card before your turn and also to keep your common attack open so you can roll attack on the next turn without navigating back to your inventory.  Doesn't yet deal with spell slots properly, so spells should be sent to chat before being used.
