### Description
This module modifies how the encumbrance bar in the actor sheet is displayed to distinguish the different levels of encumbrance when using the variant rules in **PHB pg. 175**. It does not currently support the Powerful Build feature, as doing so would require extending the base Actor5eSheet class.

To install the module, download the zip file included in the Github module directory. Extract the zip file to `/public/modules`. Restart Foundry Virtual Tabletop.
