### Description
This module adds item card buttons into the description of items, so that the item cards do not need to be pinged in chat. It does have the side effect of making it harder to ping item descriptions within chat.

To install, download the zip file included in the Github module directory. Extract the zip folder to `/public/modules`. Restart Foundry Virtual Tabletop.
