### Description
Request Roll is a module designed to help Gamemasters speed up the rolling process by requesting rolls from PCs. This can help reduce player navigation time, questions about where a roll is located, and other unforseen delays that cause chokepoitns in your game. You can select from a range of options varying from hidden rolls, where only the gm knows, to rolls with advantage or disadvantage! Consider installing this module to speed along your game!
