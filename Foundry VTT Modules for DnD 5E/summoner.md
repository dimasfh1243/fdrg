### Description
This FoundryVTT Module adds a simple compendium pack to help with DnD5e spells that summon creatures. It is nothing fancy. My players were casting find familiar and I tried to use the npc creatures that are in the DnD5e system and it wasn't working. So all I did was create actor/player types for each creature they could summon.

Hope this saves you some time.

Right now this only supports the following spells:

*Find Familiar
*Unseen Servant
