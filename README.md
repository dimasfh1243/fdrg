# Foundry VTT Modules (Universal)

**Description**: Foundry modules that work across all or most systems are noted here.  These may include reskins, general improvement mods, and more.

## [Display mode](displaymode.md)

This module makes it so that when you click the anvil in the top left of the screen, the sidebar in Foundry is hidden.

## [Entity Order](entityorder.md)

This Foundry VTT module allows you to re-order entities (Actors, Scenes, Items and Journal entries).

## [PopOut!](popout.md)

This Foundry VTT module lets you pop out journal entries into their own windows.  It is currently acting as a proof of concept.

## [Grid Scaler](scalegrid.md)

This mod allows you to resize a grid more easily within Foundry, allowing easier map setup when a grid is uneven or unclear within a background image.

## [Journal Enhancer](journalenhancer.md)

This module adds a search function for journal entries, includes a “jump to pin” button for moving the camera to a pinned journal entry, adds a zoom function for image handouts, and hides the name of a handout to users without permissions set.  Moerill includes a video showing off the mod’s utility here: [https://youtu.be/5O4yA8Kr6bs](https://youtu.be/5O4yA8Kr6bs)
