# Foundry VTT Modules (Defunct)

Foundry VTT modules that no longer work are noted here. Modules included here have been defunct for at least one month. This exists to help document previous work on Foundry Virtual Tabletop by the community, as well as to exist as a record for anyone who chooses to remain on a previous version of Foundry VTT.  

## [Actually Private Rolls](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/Actually-Private-Rolls.md)
Hides Private GM Rolls completely rather then just obfuscating the result.

## [DDB Popper (use VTTA-DNDBEYOND instead)](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/ddb-popper.md)
Opens a D&D Beyond popup for a linked actor.

## [DnD Beyond Character Importer (non-functional -- use VTTA-D&D Beyond Integration instead)](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/ddb-importer.md)
This module allows you to import character data from DnD Beyond into Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

## [Encumbrance Variant](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/foundry-vtt---encumbrance-variant-5e.md)
This module modifies how the encumbrance bar in the actor sheet is displayed to distinguish the different levels of encumbrance when using the variant rules in **PHB pg. 175**. It does not currently support the Powerful Build feature, as doing so would require extending the base Actor5eSheet class.

## [Entity Order](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/fvtt-module-entityorder.md)
This Foundry VTT module allows you to re-order entities (Actors, Scenes, Items and Journal entries).

## [FVTT-Party (Discontinued, see VTTA-Party for an successor)](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/fvtt-party.md)
This module adds a convenient button to the actorâs tab, which will track the HP, AC, and Passive Perception, Investigation, and Insight of tokens on the Canvas. Currently a WIP, and may exhibit some bugs.

## [GM Roll Message](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/gmrollmessage.md)
Sends an extra public message/hint when rolling a `gmroll` or `blindroll`.

## [Infinite Folders](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/fvtt-module-infinite-folders.md)
This Foundry VTT module allows you to create infinite depth of folders for Scenes, Actors, Items and Journals. No more limit to a depth of 2 folders (or none for Journal entries). This will also add a `New entity` button on folders so you can create it directly in the folder (does not work for Scenes though).

## [NPC Browser](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/npc-browser.md)
This module adds a search interface for actors. This enables more comfortable browsing and searching via predefined filters like challenge rating, type or ability score.

## [Roll20 NPC Importer, for 5e](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/roll20npcimporter.md)
This module allows for the importing of NPCs from Roll20, through use of JSONs exported via [VTT Enhancement Suite](https://ssstormy.github.io/roll20-enhancement-suite/). This import currently only supports NPCs created in the Roll20 OGL or Shaped version sheets. This module supports the Better NPC Sheet 5e, as well as the aDnD5e sheet in tagging actor items according to abilities, reactions, legendary actions, etc. To install, first download the module, unzip it into `/public/modules`, and then restart Foundry while it is running.

## [Spell Browser](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/Spell-Browser.md)
This module adds a search interface for spells. This enables more comfortable browsing and searching via predefined filters like spell level, class or damage type.

This module includes each SRD NPC in 5th edition, imported into Foundry VTT. This includes all of their features, immunities/resistances/vulnerabilities, actions, and much, much more. Other than lacking token images (token images do not appear to be part of the SRD), each NPC is built and ready for use in Foundry Virtual Tabletop. Included in the module is a folder containing each individual NPC json, in case you wish to experiment with importing them, or future updates break the NPCs in this module. These can be imported individually using the Roll20 NPC Importer, for 5e module.

## [Z Order (functionality integrated into core)](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/fvtt-module-zorder.md)
This Foundry VTT module lets you send tiles to the front or the back of the scene.
