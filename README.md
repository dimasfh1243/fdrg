## [Journal Enhancer](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Universal%29/journal-enhancer.md)
This module adds a search function for journal entries, includes a “jump to pin” button for moving the camera to a pinned journal entry, adds a zoom function for image handouts, and hides the name of a handout to users without permissions set. Moerill includes a video showing off the mod’s utility here: [https://youtu.be/5O4yA8Kr6bs](https://youtu.be/5O4yA8Kr6bs)

# Foundry VTT Modules for DnD 5E

Foundry modules that work within Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition are noted here. These may include NPC compendiums that may be legally shared, world saves, character sheet mods, and much, much more.

## [Better NPC Sheet 5e](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/BetterNPCSheet5e.md)
This module overwrites the default NPC sheet that comes shipped with the dnd5e system and brings it closer to the well known official template. It also includes functionality supporting separation of action categories (legendary actions, actions, reactions, etc.), and features the ability to expand and view the description of the ability/action in-sheet.

## [Beyond 20](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/Beyond20.md)
This module allows you to use and roll sheets in DnD Beyond, and have those results displayed in Foundry VTT. For more details, see Kakaroto’s module page and readme files.

## [Chat Damage Buttons](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/foundry-vtt---chat-damage-buttons.md)
This module replaces the right-click context menu with buttons on the dice-roll chat message. This allows for quicker application of damage/healing.

## [Chat Damage Buttons - Better Rolls Edition](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/.md)
A small module to add "Apply Damage" buttons to Red Reigns Better Rolls 5e Module, based on hookings Chat Damage Buttons.

## [DDB Popper](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/.md)
Opens a D&D Beyond popup for a linked actor. More info here: https://github.com/eclarke12/fvtt-modules/tree/master/ddb-popper

## [DnD Beyond Character Importer](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/foundry-vtt-modules.md)
This module allows you to import character data from DnD Beyond into Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

## [Favourite Item Tab](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/favtab.md)
Adds a Favourite tab to display a customized list of items, feats and spells. Usable with the default dnd5e Character sheet. You can add any item from the inventory, spell book or feature section of the character sheet. This module also gives access to item charges. You can add these to any item on the favourite list or remove them by changing the maximum to 0. This uses the same data that is used by Moerill#7205's adnd5e module, since this data is not supported by default.

## [Group Roll](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/grouproll.md)
Implements group ability and skill check rolls per Player's Handbook, page 175: "*If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.*" Modules also includes patches to implement the Halfling Lucky trait, and a house rule to use the average of 2d20 for normal skill and ability check rolls. Both of these patches can be disabled in config.js. All patches rely on the included `patchClass` utility function.

## [Item Sheet Buttons](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/foundry-vtt---item-sheet-buttons.md)
This module adds item card buttons into the description of items, so that the item cards do not need to be pinged in chat. It does have the side effect of making it harder to ping item descriptions within chat.

## [Loot Sheet NPC (5e)](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/foundry-vtt---loot-sheet-npc.md)
This module adds an additional NPC sheet which can be used for loot containers such as chests. It also allows spells to be automatically converted into spell scrolls by dragging them onto this sheet.

## [NPC Browser](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/npc-browser.md)
This module adds a search interface for actors. This enables more comfortable browsing and searching via predefined filters like challenge rating, type or ability score.

## [Polymorpher](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/polymorpher.md)
A module for Foundry VTT that lets you polymorph characters into any other character! Just drag any Actor (NPC or Character) on top of another Actor to change the later into the prior. Support dropping both from Compendium or the sidebar.

## [R20 Converter](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/R20%20Converter.md)
This module imports most facets of a campaign, including scenes, dynamic lighting, basic sheet information, and more. It currently does not include thorough actor information (either for PCs or NPCs), or items. Bear in mind that exporting a campaign from Roll20 may violate the EULA.

## [Roll20 NPC Importer, for 5e](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/roll20npcimporter.md)
This module allows for the importing of NPCs from Roll20, through use of JSONs exported via [VTT Enhancement Suite](https://ssstormy.github.io/roll20-enhancement-suite/). This import currently only supports NPCs created in the Roll20 OGL or Shaped version sheets. This module supports the Better NPC Sheet 5e, as well as the aDnD5e sheet in tagging actor items according to abilities, reactions, legendary actions, etc. To install, first download the module, unzip it into `/public/modules`, and then restart Foundry while it is running.

## [Spell Browser](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/Spell-Browser.md)
This module adds a search interface for spells. This enables more comfortable browsing and searching via predefined filters like spell level, class or damage type.

## [SRD Bestiary Module](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/SRD%20Bestiary%20Module.md)
This module includes each SRD NPC in 5th edition, imported into Foundry VTT. This includes all of their features, immunities/resistances/vulnerabilities, actions, and much, much more. Other than lacking token images (token images do not appear to be part of the SRD), each NPC is built and ready for use in Foundry Virtual Tabletop. Included in the module is a folder containing each individual NPC json, in case you wish to experiment with importing them, or future updates break the NPCs in this module. These can be imported individually using the Roll20 NPC Importer, for 5e module.

## [VTTA Party](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20DnD%205E/VTTA%20Party.md)
Successor to fvtt-party, which is discontinued as of now. Provides both an overview about the party in regards to AC, HP, and passive perception/investigation/insight and adds tooltips for the actors of the currently active scene.

# Foundry VTT Modules for WFRP 4E

Foundry modules that work within Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition are noted here. These may include NPC compendiums that may be legally shared, world saves, character sheet mods, changes to roll tables, etc.

## [Arcane Marks & Careers](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20for%20WFRP%204E/.md)
[This homebrew](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uTy2r0EDMdcISFqqyxeIOSadtzz-OTAg/view) supplement I made adds Lore specific careers and marks for WFRP4e.

# Foundry VTT Modules (Defunct)

Foundry VTT modules that no longer work are noted here. Modules included here have been defunct for at least one month. This exists to help document previous work on Foundry Virtual Tabletop by the community, as well as to exist as a record for anyone who chooses to remain on a previous version of Foundry VTT.  

## [aDnD5e](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/adnd5e.md)
This module expands upon the existing 5e system in Foundry VTT, adding alternative PC and NPC sheets, as well as changing the system of attacks and macros, and adds a compendium for all SRD monsters, set up for use with this module. The mod is effectively a massive expansion in the ability to edit sheets for the user’s purposes, and a revamp of how the 5E system works. It is backwards-compatible with the default sheet, and can be switched between the two as needed.

## [Encumbrance Variant](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/foundry-vtt---encumbrance-variant-5e.md)
This module modifies how the encumbrance bar in the actor sheet is displayed to distinguish the different levels of encumbrance when using the variant rules in **PHB pg. 175**. It does not currently support the Powerful Build feature, as doing so would require extending the base Actor5eSheet class.

## [FVTT-Party (Discontinued, see VTTA-Party for an successor)](Foundry%20VTT%20Modules%20%28Defunct%29/fvtt-party.md)
This module adds a convenient button to the actor’s tab, which will track the HP, AC, and Passive Perception, Investigation, and Insight of tokens on the Canvas. Currently a WIP, and may exhibit some bugs.
